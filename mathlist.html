        <h1>More indepth about my studies in math in university (+ some of my personal studies).</h1> <br>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>My topological knowledge spans all of Väisälä I-II (metric spaces + point set), any basic course in algebraic topology ((co)homology), Morse theory, degree + index theory, de Rham theory / cohomology, homotopy theory up to Hopf Fibrations and calculating higher homotopy groups.</li>
            <li>My geometric knowledge spans across most imporant stuff covered in Lee's differential geometry, most stuff in Lee's Riemannian geometry + some topics in Petersen's Riemannian geometry (such as the Bocher Technique). I have very basic knowledge of complex manifolds.</li>
            <li>My algebraic knowledge spans group theory up to Sylow theorems and basics of representation theory of finite groups. In field theory I am up to Galois theory. In (commutative + identity) ring theory I know basics. I know essentially all the basic results in algebra.</li>
            <li>Speficily in algebraic geometry I know the basics of classical theory, but very little graps on modern theory (this is something I might learn on my own at some point).</li>
            <li>In category theory im up to Riehl's book chapter 4.</li>
            <li>In analysis I know basics of real and complex analysis at MSc level. More deeper knowledge I hold in functional analysis, where I have studied almost all the important stuff such as Hilbert-/Banach space theory, distributions, LCTVS, spectral theory, Modern theory of PDE.</li>
            <li>In mathematical logic I have covered Enderton's book on set theory which covers all of ZFC from scratch.</li>
            <li>In discrete mathematics I have studied graph theory at MSc level (essentially Diestel's book).</li>
            <li>I have tried to learn lean 4 formalizing at the course hosted at Aalto university, but I couldn't find the time to complete a real project. But I am aware of how all the tactics work.</li>
