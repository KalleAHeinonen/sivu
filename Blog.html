<h2>On using AI in studying mathematics</h2>
  As of recently large language models have became extremely competent in MSc level mathematical reasoning. 
  Myself as a teacer first started experimenting with it more deeply during fall semester for a complex analysis course. 
  For example I could give it a integral to be solved by residue calculus and even the free versions of Gemini, Chatgpt and Deepseek would solve it near perfectly.
