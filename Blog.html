<h2>11.1.2026. On using AI in studying mathematics</h2>
  
  <br>As of recently large language models have became extremely competent in MSc level mathematical reasoning. 
  Myself as a teacher first started experimenting with it more deeply during fall semester for a complex analysis course to combat cheating. 
  For example I could give it a integral to be solved by residue calculus and even the free versions of Gemini, Chatgpt and Deepseek would solve it near perfectly.
  Moving forwards I would test it on deeper topics such as basic resutls on Riemann surfaces, topology and algebra.
  It would still perform relatively well if you knew when the answer was not quite complete.
  Now in the era of mathematical formalization becoming more mainstream and tools like Aristotle AI being abled to make Lean formalized code I actually see this as the future of the field.
  By far the most useful tool for me has been using large language models to generate LaTeX code. 
  Even with the most free versions, posting a picture of your hand-drawn commutative diagram will be made to Tikz-cd diagram realtively easily.</br>

  <br>In late spring Google would offer registered university students a year of Gemini pro version which I took. 
  They would later introduce the pro-thinking mode that is actually very competent in mathematics. I have been using it as my main large language model for a while now.
  I have actually gotten it to improve my studying workflow. Since I am currenly applying to PhD positions, I have had to recall much old theory that I have forgotten.
  Instead of googling or using other search engines, Gemini can connect my questions in an extremely helpful way. But this is assuming that I am a person who knows when the LLM is wrong.
  What if a student who has never had motivation to learn higher level mathematics just puts everything into a LLM and calls it a day without critical thinking? Cheating has always been around.
  Googling, old exams, old model, mathematics stackexhange solutions have always been used when stuck. So it really becomes a question of when is it beneficial for yourself.
  Certainly universities will have to move on from online submissions to combat blatant cheating.</br>

  <br>One other way of using LLM's to boost your mathematical reasoning is actually feeding your own proofs to them. We all have been using grammer-checkers for years and years. 
  It is completely normalized and not considered cheating. I have noticed that atleast feeding a proof into Gemini pro helps you easily spot your own mistakes. Especially typos as if it wasn't a spell cheker as well. 
  These are usually very minor like small assumption coming out of thin air, but in a larger proof this can be a make or break. Sometimes Gemini will roast my style choices of the argument.
  But that is for every mathematician to judge what is the context for the amount of rigour needed.</br>
